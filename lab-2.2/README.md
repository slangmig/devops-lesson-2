# Devops Lab 2.2 Docker Images

Working with Docker images

### Step 1

Go to Open the Cloud Platform Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.
Go to _Compute Engine_ and _VM Instances_. Start the VM if it isnâ€™t running and connect using _SSH_.

### Step 2

Create an SSH client key pair (public and private)
Check to see if you have SSH keys generated
`ls ~/.ssh`

If you see only the file 'authorized_keys' then you need to perform the
following step to generate an SSH client key  
--> Accept the default file  
--> Do not enter a passphrase  
`ssh-keygen -t rsa`

### Step 3

Prepare a `Dockerfile` to create a new Docker image

Create a subdirectory to hold the context for the Docker build operation  
`mkdir build`

Enter that directory  
`cd build`

Copy the public part of the SSH key pair into the build directory  
`cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub authorized_keys`  


Create a Dockerfile with the following contents. (Use _vi Dockerfile_ or _nano Dockerfile_)

`FROM alpine:latest`   
`RUN apk update`  
`RUN apk add openssh`  
`RUN adduser -g "Student User" -D student && mkdir /home/student/.ssh`  
`RUN echo "student:student" | chpasswd`  
`ADD authorized_keys /home/student/.ssh`  
`RUN chown -R student.student /home/student`  
`RUN chmod 700 /home/student/.ssh && chmod 600 /home/student/.ssh/authorized_keys`  
`RUN ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -q -N ""`    
`EXPOSE 22`  
`CMD ["/usr/sbin/sshd", "-D"]`

### Step 4

Create a new Docker image and test

Create the docker image using the Dockerfile commands   
`docker build -t ssh:alpine .`

See that the image got created.  
`docker images`

Run the new container which will contain your public SSH key and run the SSH daemon  
`docker run -d -p 2022:22 --name ssh ssh:alpine`

Make sure there were no errors.  
`docker logs ssh`

Connect to the Docker container using your the Linux ssh client on your computer  
`ssh -p 2022 student@localhost`

You are now inside the Alpine Linux container.  
Please explore!!  
Exit by typing `exit` or control-D.

### Step 5

Clean up
`docker stop ssh`  
`docker rm ssh`  
`docker rmi ssh:alpine`   
`docker rmi alpine:latest`
